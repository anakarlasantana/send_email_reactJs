![Alt text](src\assets\image.png)

# 📔 About
API developed to be used by an application for login, with possible add user and password recuperation.

# 💻 Is it running?
Yes! It is live and running and you can see it working behind the scenes by testing the web frontend. 😃

# 👀 Where can I find the web frontend and the mobile app?
You can check the repositories here:

React Web Frontend Repository

# 🚀 Technologies in the API
Typescript
React
Bootstrap
Axios
Router-dom

# 📖 DEV Diary:
- With the depreciation of the getRepository method by TypeORM, I adapted the server to accept the new way of adapting to the database through the AppDataSource.
- Use of the Ethereal Email online tool to test sending emails in development environments.
